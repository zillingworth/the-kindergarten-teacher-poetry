Creating a research use case for the AudiAnnotate workflow and using AdobePremier to create digital annotations generated a stronger sense of the distinctions between individual features of film form and allowed me to make a digital edition of my film analysis situated in the flow of individual scenes. When coupling this digital method with poetic theory, I was able to investigate the ways in which film form in The Kindergarten Teacher highlights the social nature of poetic voice as its recent theorists like Susan Stewart and William Waters have underscored. By isolating elements of film form in my annotations for the AudiAnnotate workflow, moments audio and visual overlap and cinematographic and editorial juxtapositions became especially striking. But, most critical, to my finished set of digital annotations accompanying clips from The Kindergarten Teacher in the AudiAnnotate workflow is a sense that these annotations give my readers a more experiential and intimate sense of film analysis by being situated in the filmâ€™s time and narrative.
